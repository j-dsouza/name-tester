# Overview

This is a basic application which my girlfriend and I will use to help us choose names for our upcoming baby. We need to be able to see multiple combinations of names to understand what they look like when combined.

# High-level user journey

The user needs to:
1. Enter first names, middle names, and last names
2. View combinations of those names
3. Be able to re-visit the initial lists of names, and add/remove things, based on the combined view that they have seen
4. Shortlist certain combinations of names that the user likes

# Features

1. Ability to store multiple names, split into first name, middle names, and last name.
2. Ability to view combinations of these names, including showing the initials, specifically:
   1. If there are a small number of combinations, display these all on one page
   2. If there are a large number of combinations, display a sample of names and help the user to lower the number of names they initially entered in order to reduce down to a managable number of names
3. Ability to shortlist combinations of names that the user likes
